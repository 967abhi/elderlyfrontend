          <h1>I am a Junior Software Engineer in a Healthcare Startup</h1>
          <h1>
            The concept for ElderlyCare was born from a personal experience when
            my mother, who lives in my hometown, needed assistance during a
            health check-up at AIIMS in Gorakhpur. As I am the only child and
            live in Gurgaon, I realized that there was no one available to
            accompany her during her hospital visit. She needed someone to guide
            her, assist her with the journey, and ensure she was taken care of
            until she was back home.
          </h1>
          <h1>
            This experience led me to create ElderlyCare, a platform where
            families can easily connect with professional caretakers on an
            hourly or weekly basis. This service allows seniors to get the
            support they need, whether it’s for doctor visits, daily activities,
            or any other form of assistance, all tailored to their unique
            requirements.
